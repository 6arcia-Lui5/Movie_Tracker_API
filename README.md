# Movie_Tracker_API
Movie API that tracks movie titles, reviews, and connects to a database

This is a movie review tracker API. This project is part of a bigger, Full-Stack Project that I am currently working on! 

This part of the project is the API that is responsible for CRUD operations and interaction between the React front-end and MongoDB back end.

This project is still a work in progress, and will be updated.
